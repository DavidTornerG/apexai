# Nexus UI - TODO List

## In Progress
- Test React frontend standalone without Tauri backend to verify components work correctly

## Todo
- Install Rust toolchain to enable Tauri desktop app development
- Add proper app icons to replace placeholder icon.png
- Set up system permissions for automation features (screen recording, accessibility)
- Integrate Nexus UI with existing VLM processor and Rust automation core
- Test command palette keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- Verify glassmorphism styling and dark mode animations
- Add error handling for Tauri command failures
- Test cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Set up auto-update support for production deployments
- Performance testing and optimization for real-time automation

## Completed
- Created Tauri project structure with Rust backend
- Implemented React frontend with all components (CommandPalette, ActionHistory, ScreenPreview, StatusBar)
- Added Zustand state management and Framer Motion animations
- Configured dark mode UI with glassmorphism effects
- Set up Bun package manager and Vite build system
- Created comprehensive README documentation
- Successfully started frontend dev server

## Notes
- Frontend is running at http://localhost:5173/ but Tauri features require Rust installation
- All React components should work in browser for initial testing
- Need to verify Tauri backend integration once Rust is available
